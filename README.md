# High School Schedule Generation Using Evolutionary Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a solution for generating high school schedules using evolutionary algorithms. The goal is to efficiently allocate time slots to classes, courses, and professors while considering various constraints.

## Problem Statement
Generating a high school schedule is a complex task that involves satisfying various hard and soft constraints. The challenge lies in creating a weekly schedule that accommodates the availability of professors and the educational needs of each class, without any overlap and optimizing the overall schedule quality.

## Algorithms to Implement
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: The core algorithm to generate and optimize the schedule. It should include:
  - **Population Initialization**: Creating an initial population of potential schedules.
  - **Selection Mechanism**: Choosing the best schedules for reproduction.
  - **Crossover and Mutation**: Mixing schedules and introducing variations to generate new potential solutions.
  - **Fitness Function**: A method to evaluate how well a schedule meets the constraints and requirements.
- **Constraint Handling**: Techniques to ensure that the hard constraints (like professor availability and course requirements) are strictly followed.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Additional strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the evolutionary algorithm.

## Implementation
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Random
- **Input Data Format**: Manually
